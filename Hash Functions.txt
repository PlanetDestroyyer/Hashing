Function we used to store data into hashtable is known as Hash Function.

1) Division Method

f(key) = key%m 

Example : 

For inserting the follwing from keys  in hashtable we will use as follows : 
f(12) = 12 % 10 = 2 ...................... (10 is size of hashtable)
        Now we will insert 12 in second position
f(10) = 11 % 10 = 1
        Now we will insert 10 in first position
f(40) = 44 % 10 = 4
        Now we will insert 40 in 4th row 
f(20) = 22 % 10 = 2 
        Here , 2nd place is already reserved by 12 so we cant insert 20 into that
        Now this situation is known as Collision

2) MidSquare Method :

f(key) = (key)^2

Example :

keys = {11,12,13,14,15}

h(11) = 11 x 11 = 121
h(12) = 12 x 12 = 144
h(13) = 13 x 13 = 169
h(14) = 14 x 14 = 196
h(15) = 15 x 15 = 225

Now we want to find the mid of position of the above number i.e for 121 its 2 if we want 2 digit address then we use 21 of 121 number thus we will insert at 21 position for 11

For , 11 we will insert data at 21 position &
      12 we will insert data at 44 position &
      13 we will insert data at 69 position & 
      14 we will insert data at 96 position &
      15 we will insert data at 25 position .
    
3) Folding Method(Digit Folding Method):

Example : 

keys = { 113423 ,25433,4434,1343,4665}

For inserting the data in keys we will do as follows ,

Step 1)

lets take number 113423 now we will divide this number into 2 equal parts ie 11,34,23

Step 2) 

Now we can perform any arthemtic operation on this numbers 

for simple we will do addition 

11 + 34 + 23 = 78

Step 3) 
As we got 78 we can insert that data at 78th position or at 8th position
